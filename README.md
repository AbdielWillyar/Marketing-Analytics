# My Data-Driven Marketing Project 🐍📊

In this project, I have developed my Python skills to analyze campaign performance, measure customer engagement, and predict customer churn. With real-world data, including retail transactions, I have explored social media data analysis, uncovered insights from text data, and mastered market basket analysis to understand customer preferences.

I have harnessed the power of statistical models and machine learning to predict customer lifetime value. Through hands-on exercises, I have utilized popular packages like pandas, Matplotlib, tweepy, NLTK, seaborn, NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn to enhance company's marketing strategy.

At the end of this journey, I am fully prepared to translate these skills into my very own data-driven marketing project. 🚀📈
